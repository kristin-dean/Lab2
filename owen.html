    <p>Wilfred Owen was born in England pre-World War I and began writing poetry as a teenager as a means of coping
      with constant family relocations. Owen was well-educated in England and following a short teaching career,
      he enlisted in the English Armed Forces and was drafted to the Manchester Regiment in 1916.</p>
    <p>Owen was badly wounded in 1917, diagnosed with what is now known as PTSD, and hospitalized in Edinburgh.
      it was during this time that Owen met and discovered other poets and began to write many of his most famous poems.
      In 1918, Owen returned to the battlefield in 1918 and was killed in action.</p>

    <h2>Highlighted Work</h2>
    <h3>Dulce et Decorum Est</h3>
    <p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br />
      Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br />
      Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br />
      And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br />
      Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br />
      But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br />
      Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br />
      Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.<br />
      <br />
      Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,<br />
      Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br />
      But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br />
      And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime...<br />
      Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br />
      As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<br />
      <br />
      In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br />
      He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br />
      <br />
      If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br />
      Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br />
      And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br />
      His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;<br />
      If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br />
      Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br />
      Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br />
      Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—<br />
      My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br />
      To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br />
      The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est</i><br />
      <i>Pro patria mori.</i></p>
