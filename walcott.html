    <p> Born on the island of Saint Lucia to a family of mixed African, English, and Dutch descent, Derek Walcott's household was filled with his family
    reciting poetry. At first, Walcott took after his father, a painter, and studied under Saint Lucian native Harold Simmons, but later soon discovered modernist
    poetry and was first published at 14.</p>
    <p>Moving from Trinidad to Boston to Alberta for prestigious teaching positions, Walcott has earned a host of awards and honors including a
      Guggenheim Fellowship, A MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, and the Nobel Prize in Literature following Omeros, his epic poem. Before his death in 2017, 
    Walcott became one of the first knights of the Order of Saint Lucia.</p>

    <h2>Highlighted Work</h2>
    <h3>Sea Grapes</h3>
    <p>That sail which leans on light,<br />tired of islands,<br />a schooner beating up the Caribbean<br /><br />
     for home, could be Odysseus,<br />home-bound on the Aegean;<br />that father and husband's<br /><br />
      longing, under gnarled sour grapes, is<br />like the adulterer hearing Nausicaa's name<br />in every gull's outcry.<br /><br />
      This brings nobody peace. The ancient war<br />between obsession and responsibility<br />will never finish and has been the same<br /><br />
      for the sea-wanderer or the one on shore<br />now wriggling on his sandals to walk home,<br /> since Troy sighed its last flame,<br /><br />
      and the blind giant's boulder heaved the trough<br/>from whose groundswell the great hexameters come<br/>to the conclusions of exhausted surf.<br/><br/>
      The classics can console. But not enough.
