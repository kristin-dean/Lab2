    <p>Madisen Kuhn started publishing poetry at a very young age. She was still just a teenager when she published
      her first book, entitled <i>Eighteen Years</i>, and was a mere 21 years old when she published her second book,
      <i>Please Don't Go Before I Get Better</i>. Kuhn is now working on a third book, title unknown.</p>
    <p>Kuhn's primary audience is young adults, young women especially. Topics of hers include love, mental 
    health, identity, confidence, and a sense of belonging. She currently resides and writes in Charlottesville, 
    Virginia, USA. </p>

    <h3>Joy</h3>
    <p>it's when<br />your heart is full<br />and smiling<br />
      when life tries to<br />chip your happiness away<br />and it's courage<br />
      when fear tries to<br />take ahold of your direction<br />and it's peace<br />
      when nothing in your<br />life is stable<br />and it is love in your bones<br />
      when the rest of the<br />is telling you no</p>
