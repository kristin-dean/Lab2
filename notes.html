    <h1>Notes and Questions</h1>
    <p> Below are some questions remaining after completing Lab 2:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you orient text paragraphs or images in the center of the page as opposed to the left of the page?</li>
      <li>How do you display white space (HTML normally skips the white space)?</li>
      <li>I'm not used to seeing text so close to the left of the screen on websites I visit often; why does that look like that for us?</li>
    </ul>
