    <p>Born to an expressionist painter and irish diplomat in 1944, Eavan Boland moved to London at the age of six. Returning eight years later,The effects of displacement
      and exposure to anti-irish attitudes were a foundational experience. Publishing a pamphlet at the age of 18 and graduating with First Class Honors, Boland's promise
      to the literary world was apparent immediately.
    </p>
    <p> Having been published semi-consistently since 1962, accrued an impressive bench of awards, and been recognized with honorary degrees from universities on 
      both sides of the atlantic, Boland's poems of women's place in history, in art history, and of the trials of motherhood and femininity have clearly resonanted.
      She currently splits her time between Dublin and Palo Alto.

    <h2>Highlighted Work</h2>
    <h3>Quarantine</h3>
    <p>In the worst hour of the worst season<br /> &nbspof the worst year of a whole people<br />a man set out from the workhouse with his wife.
      <br /> He was walking – they were both walking – north.
      <br /><br />She was sick with famine fever and could not keep up.<br />
      &nbspHe lifted her and put her on his back.<br />He walked like that west and west and north.<br />
      Until at nightfall under freezing stars they arrived.<br />
      In the morning they were both found dead.<br />&nbspOf cold. Of hunger. Of the toxins of a whole history.
      <br />But her feet were held against his breastbone.<br />The last heat of his flesh was his last gift to her.<br />
      Let no love poem ever come to this threshold.<br />&nbspThere is no place here for the inexact<br/> praise of the easy graces and sensuality of the body.
      <br /> There is only time for this merciless inventory:<br /><br />Their death together in the winter of 1847.<br/>
       &nbspAlso what they suffered. How they lived.<br /> And what there is between a man and woman.<br /> And in which darkness it can best be proved.<br />
